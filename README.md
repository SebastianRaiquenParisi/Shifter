# Shifter

Game developed in Unity using C#, this is the first real project I've done programming and will forever be something I hold close to my heart since I shared the experience with two of my best friends.

We made a 3d game with 2d minigames, I was seventeen years old when we made this project and clearly this is not the best game ever and its flawed to the core but the minigames are fun and were really fun to make!

Open up the Minijuego folder and play the Minijuego 2.exe! Have fun!

# Shifter

Game developed in Unity using C#, this is the first real project I've done programming and will forever be something I hold close to my heart since I shared the experience with two of my best friends.

We made a 3d game with 2d minigames, I was seventeen years old when we made this project and clearly this is not the best game ever, its flawed to the core and filled with spaghetti code but this was my first real project that got me into programming and made me love this amazing carreer path.

Open up the Minijuego folder and play the Minijuego 2.exe! Have fun!
